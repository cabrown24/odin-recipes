    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple and flavorful vegan coleslaw is ready within just five minutes!
        Creamy and refreshing, this coleslaw uses pre-shredded cabbage and a
        five-ingredient dressing. Vegan mayo can be a little expensive, but the 
        other ingredients are very cheap.
    </p>
    <p>Since the cabbage is pre-shredded, and mixed with carrots, the only real 
        work is mixing the dressing, and then mixing the dressing into the veggies.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Cups Shredded Cabbage and Carrots Mix</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Vegan Mayo</li>
        <li>2 Tbs Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbs Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp celery seed</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the vegan mayo, sugar, apple cider vinegar,
            celery seed, and salt.</li>
        <li>Whisk until smooth and combined.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage/carrot mix to the bowl with the dressing.</li>
        <li>Mix well so the cabbage is coated in the dressing. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p><strong>Cut the cabbage mix smaller</strong> before adding the dressing. This is totally unnecessary, but 
    the smaller pieces can be nice. Find <strong>good vegan mayo</strong>. This can make all the difference.
    Lastly, try and <strong>let it chill for 3 hours or longer</strong> before serving. This will help the flavors
    disperse into the cabbage better, and lead to a more powerful combination, with slightly softer cabbage.
