    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Vegan Buttermilk</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Cup unsweetened soy milk</li>
                <li>1 Tbs apple cider vinegar</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>The Rest</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 Cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 Tbs baking powder</li>
                <li>2 tsp granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (8 Tbs) cold vegan butter</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper
                (or lightly spray with oil). Measure 1/2 Cup (8Tbs) vegan butter, cut into small
                pieces and place in the freezer for five minutes. <em>You want the Butter
                to be very cold for tall, flaky biscuits.</em>
            </li>
            <li>In a glass measuring cup, combine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar. Set
                aside to curdle. This is your vegan buttermilk.
            </li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt to a large mixing bowl or food 
                processor. Whisk or pulse to combine. Now add the vegan butter pieces to the dry
                and either cut into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter or pulse several times
                in the processor until coarse crumbs form. If you used a food processor, dump the
                mixture into a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the vegan buttermilk into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients, saving
                a little bit for brushing the tops (about 2 Tbs). Gently stir until almost combined,
                but do not over mix. It will not be a clean ball of dough at this point, and it will
                be quite moist and sticky.
            </li>
            <li>Scoop the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently work it together
                with your hands, shaping it into a rectangle. Flour your hands to prevent sticking, 
                and sprinkle a little flour on the dough if it's sticky. Just don't add too much, 
                otherwise the biscuits will be dry.
            </li>
            <li>Gently flatten the dough into a rectangle, the fold one side into the center, then 
                the other side. Turn the dough a half turn, and flatten again into a rectangle shape. 
                Repeat the process two more times. This is what makes the <strong>wonderful layers</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>On the last folding, gently flatten the dough until it's about 1 inch thick. 
                Cut into circles using a biscuit cutter, and do not twist the cutters. Try to get as many 
                biscuits the first time. Re roll any scraps until you have 10-12 biscuits.
            </li>
            <li>Arrange them so they are touching on the pan, this helps them bake up tall. Brush the 
                tops with the remaining buttermilk and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown 
                on top and tall. Serve warm with a dab of vegan butter and jam.
            </li>
            <li>Cover any leftover biscuits and keep at room temperature for 3-4 days, or a bit longer 
                in the refrigerator. They freeze well, too.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can substitute almold milk, coconut milk, cashew milk, or possibly even oat milk for 
            the soy milk if desired. Just make sure the milk is unsweetened and unflavored.
        </li>
        <li>Earth Balance sticks work well for the vegan butter, but other brands will work just 
            as well (Such as Melt or Miyokos).
        </li>
    </ul>
